This repository contains the code and analysis for my bachelor's thesis, which explores Inception models and the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) metric. The work focuses on understanding the limitations of FID, investigating scenarios where the metric fails, and proposing improvements to enhance its reliability in evaluating generative models.
